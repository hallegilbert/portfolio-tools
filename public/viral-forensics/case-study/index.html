THE BREAKDOWN
PROBLEM
I spent years making content for hospitality brands and watching some of it perform and some of it not. The post-mortems were always the same: vague feedback, gut-feel explanations, and a few metrics pulled out of context.
CONSTRAINT
What I actually wanted was a forensic breakdown. Not "this did well because it was relatable" but why it was relatable, what triggered the share, and where the viewer almost scrolled past.
SOLUTION
A tool where you paste any social post (caption, transcript, full text), select the platform, optionally add metrics, and get a structured analysis: hook identification, retention architecture, a psychology layer mapping the emotional triggers behind shares and comments, cultural timing, platform-specific algorithm fit, and a keep/kill/test prescription.

We stopped doing "signature cocktails." Every drink on the menu is built around what's in season within 30 miles of the restaurant. Last week that meant a clarified apple shrub with cardamom. This week it's a persimmon old fashioned. The menu changes when the harvest does.

VERDICT
Strong share trigger. The post works because it frames a business decision as a philosophy, making the audience feel like insiders.

THE TAKEAWAY
Most content audits describe what happened without explaining the mechanics. This tool forces precision. When I say a post worked because of a curiosity gap combined with identity signaling, that gives a team something to actually use when they make the next piece. That is the difference between a post-mortem and a playbook.
